This information was hard to find. I don't see information about home isolation. It was too small. I'm glad they allow only vaccinated people. Those number are too small. The number is overwhelming. I see so two weeks of quarantine or PCR test. That's fine. It was okay to find. It was hard to find. It was too difficult to find. It was a big problem. I couldn't find it. I thought it would be here but it wasn't. Covid numbers increased a lot I see. That's a lot of restrictions. Website looks outdated, I'm not sure this information is correct. I don't see it here. I can't find it. Not very straightforward. I think I just got lost. This doesn't tell me much information. That was okay, no problem. Wish that was more accessible. Overall enough information, I feel like I found what I needed. Clearly wrong. I don't like this design, hard to search anything. Not too hard to find. Numbers are too small. Not bad but could be better. I was thinking it would be here, but it wasn't. Very clear information. Not visible. I am looking for vaccination information I was hoping to find it here. This was frustrating. I don't think that's right but I'm gonna check. I don't see anything down here that would be useful. Okay that might be useful. Okay that was pretty easy. I don't see the tab. I think next best thing is going to be Arrival. I feel stuck. I feel confused. I don't know what this means. It's not translated. This doesn't work. Okay, let's choose something else. I have no idea.
