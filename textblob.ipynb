      "How do I understand this?\n",
      "Oh yeah, yeah of course.\n",
      "OK, there is some English here and there.\n",
      "OK, you will need your cell phone number.\n",
      "OK, I'm going to click on this later, OK?\n",
      "1st I need to finish this so I'm.\n",
      "I would need to print this and scan it or use a something to write on PDF files.\n",
      "To be able to, oh, you can actually click on this.\n",
      "But you cannot feel.\n",
      "Yeah, I cannot feel anything, can you?\n",
      "I don't think you can.\n",
      "So this is French, sorry.\n",
      "OK, you can't I guess.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "So I don't exactly understand why this is printed here, but this is good information about how to receive the digital code certificate and.\n",
      "Uh, I guess.\n",
      "I don't know what's the difference.\n",
      "I don't have it.\n",
      "Remember, I guess this is to help you getting it back.\n",
      "OK. Can I see?\n",
      "OK, again the personal data.\n",
      "I can click on it, but the rest I cannot fill so I would need to.\n",
      "Either print it and scan it, or and write on it.\n",
      "Physically or get it into a software where I can write on PDF OK.\n",
      "So what was the plan again?\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "What are the steps you need to do?\n",
      "Try describing out loud.\n",
      "How you would fill the forms that you find to apply for vaccination from abroad.\n",
      "OK, so that's what I would do.\n",
      "Depending on my situation, if I don't have a software where I can write the thing in in the PDF.\n",
      "I would print it and write it up physically.\n",
      "And then re scan it.\n",
      "I guess for both of these file of these forms.\n",
      "OK. What are steps that you need to do?\n",
      "So apparently I need to fill these two.\n",
      "And then submit.\n",
      "To the doctor.\n",
      "So submit the the forms and the proof of previous vaccination.\n",
      "So I I this is not part of the of the test I guess.\n",
      "But I have them to talk to at the vaccination.\n",
      "Enter where you get vaccinated without prior registration so you.\n",
      "Could just go there at vaccination center.\n",
      "If you find 1, submit the forms to the doctor and your proof of previous vaccination.\n",
      "And dumb.\n",
      "And that's it.\n",
      "And then you could get the pass.\n",
      "Wait?\n",
      "OK, now I'm curious about this.\n",
      "So I should be able to click on something called Nimni PO.\n",
      "Mtem Huh?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Nobody.\n",
      "It's called the same.\n",
      "So maybe I need to type?\n",
      "Certificate.\n",
      "OK. And The thing is, I cannot find it here.\n",
      "It's I mean maybe I can.\n",
      "But there's a lot of things here.\n",
      "Rotations, I don't think it is here.\n",
      "Where else could it be?\n",
      "Did it already did it all?\n",
      "Maybe this is not OK.\n",
      "It was the closest to what I what I'm looking for.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Clinton pass maybe?\n",
      "So.\n",
      "And just get your forms, get a proof of vaccination.\n",
      "And go to the vaccination centre.\n",
      "Give all the papers to the doctor.\n",
      "And that's it pretty much.\n",
      "And if you want the pass.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Oh yeah, if you want rather the the the digital digital copy certificate you just need.\n",
      "So I didn't get to this step, but I'm I'm not sure it's what is required anyway.\n",
      "So let's say.\n",
      "In a real situation I would.\n",
      "Just afterward need to go on this.\n",
      "And dumb, and that's it.\n",
      "And you get everything you you need, uhm?\n",
      "Pretty easy to understand I think.\n",
      "Because once again, there's not a lot of text, it's very.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Right, the first thing is.\n",
      "There's two links.\n",
      "Well, actually three if you count to double homepage.\n",
      "But there's two links.\n",
      "You just click them and and the links are directly forms.\n",
      "So apart from the fact you cannot directly fill in the forms and you need to use another strategy to fill them, it's pretty straightforward.\n",
      "You just click the the forms, you fill them and that's it, you huge.\n",
      "So the only part is how do I get a vaccination center?\n",
      "But maybe you could get it.\n",
      "So I think you should be able to get one here, right if.\n",
      "If you were to.\n",
      "Uhm yeah, you know.\n",
      "Real life stories.\n",
      "I think you could get.\n",
      "The vaccination center from this.\n",
      "Oh, here it is.\n",
      "Digital copy, pasty you found it?\n",
      "I guess.\n",
      "Did I?\n",
      "Ah, yes, that's what it is.\n",
      "OK, I'm not gonna go further because it's all in Slovak but.\n",
      "And I understand none of it.\n",
      "But I guess if you called this number or.\n",
      "Uhm, vaccination.\n",
      "Without registration, maybe that's that's the one.\n",
      "Oof.\n",
      "OK. Obviously I'm not gonna read this, but it looks like you can, so I see I see things I understand like.\n",
      "Time and the name of the of the vaccine.\n",
      "So this is probably in days.\n",
      "This is probably the days available for.\n",
      "And the region.\n",
      "Probably you get the the location here I guess.\n",
      "So yeah, you've got the the centers that are available for vaccination I assume.\n",
      "18 + 2012 to 17.\n",
      "And.\n",
      "I don't know 1217.\n",
      "Oh maybe next week.\n",
      "Yeah, that's the week after, OK?\n",
      "And you have 18 plus for the week after as well.\n",
      "OK, well, it's yeah.\n",
      "You can get your vaccination center here.\n",
      "So maybe this is the only thing lacking.\n",
      "Is where do you get your vaccination center and maybe information in English?\n",
      "If you're coming from.\n",
      "A foreign country, but overall it's pretty.\n",
      "It's pretty understandable what you need to do.\n",
      "OK task #14.\n",
      "What are the next steps after filling the forms?\n",
      "I just boiled it.\n",
      "I guess you need to do what.\n",
      "I just did a go to.\n",
      "So you can actually register, but is it?\n",
      "Can you actually Register here for the.\n",
      "4IN.\n",
      "I think it is set here.\n",
      "You need to not.\n",
      "Register here.\n",
      "Will you get vaccinated without prior registration?\n",
      "So you need to go.\n",
      "Here.\n",
      "You need to.\n",
      "Understand Slovak first.\n",
      "Or swap into.\n",
      "Oh, you actually get a. Ah, Nope.\n",
      "I thought you would have English.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "So yeah, I think you've got the address.\n",
      "Uh, the region.\n",
      "The city I guess.\n",
      "It would be better to have this in.\n",
      "English, probably.\n",
      "And I assumed this would.\n",
      "Translate the page in English, but it doesn't seem like it's working.\n",
      "And the message I'm getting here.\n",
      "I don't understand it.\n",
      "Yeah, you you.\n",
      "You get the time and date.\n",
      "Of where of where you can go when.\n",
      "Apparently, and what vaccine can I get?\n",
      "And then you need to just show up I guess.\n",
      "It's pretty weird that you.\n",
      "Yeah, I guess that's what it is.\n",
      "You need to just show up there.\n",
      "And get your two forms your.\n",
      "Uhm, proof of previous vaccination and show this to the doctor and that's it.\n",
      "I think that's it.\n",
      "Next steps after filling the forms.\n",
      "So you need to take them with you physically.\n",
      "I guess you would need to print them.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Print your proof of if you have it online, print your proof of.\n",
      "Nation.\n",
      "Original and copy OK.\n",
      "So you need to get the original as well, so probably not online one.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "And you need to go on on this.\n",
      "Find your.\n",
      "Find a date and a time that suits you and.\n",
      "Go there with other forms and the proof of vaccination.\n",
      "I think that's it.\n",
      "You have completed all the tasks we'd like to you.\n",
      "To answer the phone questions by describing the answers out loud and also by selecting the number of the on the rating scale that best matches your enter.\n",
      "Please explain your decision.\n",
      "Do not refresh the website during the questionnaire, otherwise your answer will be lost.\n",
      "Is carbon sump your overall experience with the website?\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "I'd say 3.\n",
      "Because once again, it it it it's about.\n",
      "Not having anything to to have to search through categories and.\n",
      "Have something where you can always go back to like this is the home page.\n",
      "It doesn't look like home page.\n",
      "And there's a lot of information on the homepage.\n",
      "Lot of direct links without categories, and you just.\n",
      "It it's.\n",
      "It's a bit much to me, but other than that you get, you get the statistics here on the front page if that's what you're looking for, is great.\n",
      "And you get a few of of the of the important information.\n",
      "This here is good.\n",
      "I think it's.\n",
      "It hits your eyes pretty nicely, so I like this.\n",
      "But it would be even better if there was no.\n",
      "Author.\n",
      "Things everywhere because there's like there's a lot of things here.\n",
      "Going on so I'd say.\n",
      "I would like it to be this only and maybe the statistics and a menu where you can select your.\n",
      "UM, the wear through the categories and stuff you can select.\n",
      "The page you want to.\n",
      "Visit.\n",
      "Uh, how did you feel about obtaining the information from the website?\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "It's.\n",
      "It's going to be around 3:00, I think again.\n",
      "It's easier to come to travel through the website.\n",
      "But there are still I'm going to.\n",
      "Actually, I'm going to put 2.\n",
      "Uhm, because even though you understand you still need to.\n",
      "You still still need to put in a lot of effort into.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "Into finding the information you want.\n",
      "And even when you find it, it's.\n",
      "Hard to really understand what is required every time.\n",
      "So overall, not very good I I think.\n",
      "And it's mostly because of the time you spend searching for the information and and you are not exactly sure you found everything.\n",
      "Because at some point, maybe you're going to find something else elsewhere and you're not exactly sure.\n",
      "But you found everything you wanted.\n",
      "Yep, describe how understandable the information from the website was and your level of confidence in being able to use the information.\n",
      "Uhm, it wasn't as tenable, just.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
      "It feels like you have to do a lot of investigation to be sure you're not lacking anything.\n",
      "So in terms of.\n",
      "With confidence.\n",
      "In being able to use the information, I'd say it's.\n",
      "On the low part I'd say 2 1/2, but how understandable?\n",
      "I felt like it was pretty understandable and it was.\n",
      "Well described, well written, I'd say.\n",
      "The only thing is it's very vertical, very long and very all these dumb.\n",
      "Things to read and to open close and it's it's a very.\n",
      "Very long.\n",
      "Some process to get through this so understandably, yes, it's just a bit hard to get.\n",
      "Level of confidence a bit low, but.\n",
      "It's not that you don't trust the source, it's that you you're not.\n",
      "You don't trust yourself.\n",
      "On having everything you need, so I'd say overall three.\n",
      "I'd say I'd say.\n",
      "Uhm?\n",
